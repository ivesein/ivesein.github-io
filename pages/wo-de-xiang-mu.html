    <p>I work quite a lot on OpenStack, which is good fun. I do code reviews, programming and some gate keeping. Work mostly on TripleO, the Tempest framework and help with Cinder/Glance. I have on github some little things as well, here is a short introduction to these:</p>
<p>svbhack
    This is a responsive theme for Pelican (a static site generator) and it is my hack of a svbtle-like theme made using HTML5 and CSS3; it also is the theme that this blog uses and it's got quite some love on github!
opinoid
    Opinoid is a TornadoWeb based web application. It bascially collects articles from an arbitrary list of RSS/Atom feeds and provides visitors with a view of the articles sorted basing on user's votes and comments. I have big hopes to make this into a "Planet" but am working on it only in my spare time. The backend storage is MongoDB and with this app I learnt how to use map/reduce with it.
tichawi
    Tichawi is Opinoid reloaded. A web application which syndicates feeds from a set of known RSS/Atom sources and provides visitors with a sorted list of articles (like Reddit), based on user’s votes and, ideally, links popularity. It uses Django, MariaDB, jQuery and Bootstrap 3.
myshoppinglist
    This is a Flask based web application built using jQuery Mobile. The backend storage is MongoDB. The app allows you to add/remove items to/from a list and to share it with other people/computers! The main idea was to build a quick and dirty app which would eventually replace my hand written shopping list. It is deployed on OpenShift.
rhc-quickstart / hellotornado
    As an OpenShift enthusiast AND TornadoWeb user I decided to write a quickstart guide for the command line client of OpenShift (called rhc) and a template for using TornadoWeb web applications on OpenShift. The latter basically deploys TornadoWeb with-a-single-command leverage the use of pip on the target instance and seems to have been useful to a number of others as it's got some stars on github.
mlapd
    MLAPD is a mailing list access manager which uses LDAP to check for users' rights to post messages. It's written using the non-optimal python's asynchat module but works in conjunction with Postfix, as an Access Policy Delegation daemon, which covers most of the possible troubles. It lacks of a web based management interface but one can quickly subscribe/unsubscribe people to the lists by just adding/removing the subscribers to the corresponding LDAP group. The main idea for this is to manage the subscribers into an LDAP and plug into Postfix just a plugin which would check for the senders permission.
cruxppc
    CRUX PPC is a port of the CRUX distro to the Power architecture. It's a GNU system with a Linux kernel and runs on Apple NewWorld (both 32 and 64bit) PowerPC, YDL Powerstation, Genesi PegasosII and EFIKA, ACube Sam440ep and Sam460ex, IBM Power Systems servers. I've started this project back in 2005 but after a few years I stopped contributing because of lack of interest. Good to know that other people have kept over it.     </p>
